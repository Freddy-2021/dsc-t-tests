    "# Conducting T-Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously you learned how to construct confidence intervals using the z-distribution (standard normal distribution), then learned how to construct them using the t-distribution instead. Using the t-distribution rather than the z-distribution for constructing confidence intervals allows you to handle instances where you don't know the population standard deviation or you have a small sample size. The same is true with hypothesis testing — a t-test (using the t-distribution) can be used instead of a z-test (using the z-distribution) under these conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compare when you would use one sample vs. two sample t-tests\n",
    "* Perform a one sample t-test and make conclusions about an experiment based on the results\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis Testing Using the t-Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in frequentist hypothesis testing, you construct a test statistic from the measured data and use the value of that statistic to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test statistic is a lower-dimensional summary of the data but still maintains the discriminatory power necessary to determine whether a result is statistically significant for a given significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## t-test\n",
    "\n",
    "t-tests (also called Student’s t-test) are very practical hypothesis tests that can be employed to compare two averages (means) to assess if they are different from each other. You should run a t-test when you either:\n",
    "* Don’t know the population standard deviation \n",
    "* You have a small sample size    \n",
    "\n",
    "Like a $z$-test, the t-test also tells you how significant the differences are i.e. it lets you know if those differences could have happened by chance. In this lesson, you will get an introduction to t-tests, in particular, the 1-sample t-test. There are additional kinds of t-tests including the 2-sample t-test and paired t-test. This lesson will show you the mathematical calculations behind a 1-sample t-test as well as how to perform a t-test in Python using NumPy and SciPy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed descriptions of hypothesis testing with t-tests can be found [here](http://www.mas.ncl.ac.uk/~njnsm/medfac/docs/ttest) and [here](http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/understanding-t-tests-t-values-and-t-distributions)\n",
    "\n",
    "### One Sample t-test\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1-sample t-test is a statistical procedure used to determine **whether a sample of observations could have been generated by a process with a specific mean**. The one sample t-test compares the mean of your sample data to a known value. For example, you might want to know how your sample mean compares to a known population mean.  Here is a quick example of a scenario where a 1-sample t-test could be applied. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Suppose you are interested in determining whether a bakery production line produces cakes with a weight of exactly 2 pounds. To test this hypothesis, you could collect a sample of cakes from the production line, measure their weights, and compare the sample with a value of 2 using a one-sample t-test.* \n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Sample t-tests\n",
    "\n",
    "The two-sample t-test is used to determine if two population means are equal. The main types of two-sampled t-tests are paired and independent tests. Paired tests are useful for determining how different a sample is affected by a certain treatment. In other words, the individual items/people in the sample will **remain the same** and researchers are comparing how they change after treatment. Here is an example of a scenario where a two-sample paired t-test could be applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "*The US Olympic weightlifting team is trying out a new workout technique to in an attempt to improve everyone's powerlifting abilities. Did the program have an effect at a 95% significance level?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are looking at how specific individuals were affected by a treatment, we would use the paired t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent two-sample t-tests are for when we are comparing two different, unrelated samples to one another. Unlike paired t-tests, we are not taking paired differences because there is no way to pair two unrelated samples! Here is an example of a scenario where a two-sample independent t-test could be applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Agricultural scientists are trying to compare the difference in soybean yields in two different counties in Mississippi.*\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn more about the specifics of two sample t-tests in future lessons, but this lesson will focus on executing a one sample t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Samples vs. Tails\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we now have two different labels where \"one\" and \"two\" appear repeatedly. Let's make sure the difference is clear!\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously we learned about *one-tail* and *two-tail* tests. A one-tail test means that the alternative hypothesis contains something like $>$ or $<$, which means that we are only looking at the area under the curve on one side. Whereas a two-tail test means that the alternative hypothesis contains something like $\\neq$ (which could mean greater than *or* less than), which means that we are looking at the area under the curve in two places, one on each side.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-sample tests can be one-tail or two-tail tests, as can two-sample tests. Some quick examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One-sample one-tail: $H_{a}: \\mu < 3$\n",
    "* One-sample two-tail: $H_{a}: \\mu \\neq 3$\n",
    "* Two-sample one-tail: $H_{a}: \\mu_{1} < \\mu_{2}$\n",
    "* Two-sample two-tail: $H_{a}: \\mu_{1} \\neq \\mu_{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions for Performing t-tests \n",
    "\n",
    "When performing various kinds of t-tests, you assume that the sample observations have numeric and continuous values. You also assume that the sample observations are independent from each other (that is, that you have a simple random sample) and that the samples have been drawn from normal distributions. You can visually inspect the distribution of your sample using a histogram, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of unpaired two-sample t-tests, you also assume that the populations the samples have been drawn from have the same variance. For paired two-sample t-tests, you assume that the _difference_ between the two sets of samples are normally distributed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regardless of the type of t-test you are performing, there are 5 main steps to executing them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Set up null and alternative hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Choose a significance level \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Calculate the test statistic (t-value)\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Determine the critical t-value (find the rejection region)\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Compare t-value with critical t-value to determine if we can reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you're going to go through these 5 steps in more detail to complete a t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with a sample experiment:"
